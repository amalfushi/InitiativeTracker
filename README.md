# InitiativeTracker

*very in-development*
A simple initiative tracker for tabletop gaming. Implements drag and drop functionality to allow for easily re-organizing.

### Planned 
*Character cards
*Initiative number as you create characters
*Auto-sorting
*Attacks/dice-rolls
*Simple game-agnostic stats on character cards
*Login/registration to save initiate/encounter setups
